# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Due to the large amount of new information introduced in a full-stack coding boot camp, this website was developed to help students keep track of the topics covered and provides some notes to help understand each topic better.

With this study guide website, students can refer to each section to remind themselves of important notes and reference handy code functions for topics covered throughout the class. 

In addition to using the notes listed, students can access the DevTools console to get a random suggestion on which of the four topics they should study first. 

In creating this website, the four topics covered in the boot camp were all utilized, and the notes in each section were created as new information was introduced in each step. Future students should use this website to help replicate their own study guide webpage.
